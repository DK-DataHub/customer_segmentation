# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Project

This project applies **KMeans clustering** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.  
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups and provide insights for targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Performed **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, scaling features).
- Applied **KMeans clustering** with `n_clusters=3` and reproducible results using `random_state=42`.
- Generated **cluster profiles** to summarize average customer attributes per segment.
- Exported results to `customer_offers_output.csv` for further analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Export**: CSV outputs for reporting
